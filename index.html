        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <h2>What it Says</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence states the principles on which our government, and <strong>identity as Americans,</strong> are based. Unlike the other founding documents, the Declaration of Independence is not <em>legally binding,</em> but it is powerful. Abraham Lincoln called it “a rebuke and a stumbling-block to tyranny and oppression.” It continues to inspire people around the world to fight for freedom and equality.</p>

Congress cast “the causes which impel them to separation” in universal terms for an international audience. Join our fight, reads the subtext, and you join humankind’s fight against tyranny.</p>

            <li>"He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good."

                This refers generally to any time colonial legislatures passed internal laws that the British Parliament refused to ratify.</li>
            <li>"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them."

                A reference to colonial self-rule being removed; the royal governors were appointed by England, and Parliament sometimes instructed their governors to withhold ratification on legislation they did not agree with.</li>
